# GlobalClicker
This is a project I'm working on which is going to be a global clicker game.
Everyone will join together and click for coins.
Everyone will have the same amount of coins.
But if someone buys an upgrade, the amount it cost to upgrade gets deducted from eveyone.
So the amount of coins is a global amount and is shared across everyone but the upgrades are personal.

## Play the game

## Currently working on
- Optimising API (currently when you tap fast the api crashes and doesn't save or get coins from the servers)
- Make the store working
